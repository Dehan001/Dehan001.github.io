abstract: In this study, we examine and analyze the behavior of several graph-based
  models for Bangla text classification tasks. Graph-based algorithms create heterogeneous
  graphs from text data. Each node represents either a word or a document, and each
  edge indicates relationship between any two words or word and document. We applied
  the BERT model and different graph-based models including TextGCN, GAT, BertGAT,
  and BertGCN on five different datasets including SentNoB, Sarcasm detection, BanFakeNews,
  Hate speech detection, and Emotion detection datasets for Bangla text. BERT′s model
  bested the TextGCN and the GAT models by a large difference in terms of accuracy,
  Macro F1 score, and weighted F1 score. BertGCN and BertGAT are shown to outperform
  standalone graph models and BERT model. BertGAT excelled in the Emotion detection
  dataset and achieved a 1%-2% performance boost in Sarcasm detection, Hate speech
  detection, and BanFakeNews datasets from BERT′s performance. Whereas, BertGCN outperformed
  BertGAT by 1% for SetNoB, and BanFakeNews datasets while beating BertGAT by 2% for
  Sarcasm detection, Hate Speech, and Emotion detection datasets. We also examined
  different variations in graph structure and analyzed their effects.
